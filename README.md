# NLP project - Comment toxic

This project is help me understand the flow of NLP development by using Tensorflow and PyTorch.

Process
----
1. Loading Data
2. Preprocess Data
    - tokenize
    - embedding
3. Define a Deep NLP NN
4. Evaluate Model

Data
----
Data is comming from kaggle [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).


Description
----
There are two version of implementation, first is done by tensorflow, mainly use LSTM to build the model; the second is done by PyTorch, mainly use BERT to classify the toxic comments.

Hope you enjoy it!
